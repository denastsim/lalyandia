The emulator of Lineage 2. I'm sure everyone know that Java emulators have many problems with performance, bugs and etc...
Basically I planning to use datapack from PTS.

Emulator will have in base next things:
- Actors (With pool of actors, cluster, state machine), all things from ProtoActor.
- Postgres as basic database
- Tile38 for geoposition things
- vndr for vendor way
